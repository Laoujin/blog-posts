In many text-editors there are means to easily jump with the cursor between different points in the code and this is no different in Notepad++.
Bookmarks have their own margin where they can be toggled with a mouse click.

They can also be **toggled with "CTRL + F2"**. Use **"F2" and "SHIFT + F2" to jump** back and forth between them.

<div style="clear: both"></div>

All bookmarks can be cleared from the "Search –> Bookmark" menu. There are some more related options in that
menu which might even seem pretty odd at first.
That is until you combine them with the “Mark” tab in the "**Find Dialog (CTRL + F)**".

Suddenly you can write a regular expression to capture certain lines of text and cut those lines with a single command. Pretty neat!
