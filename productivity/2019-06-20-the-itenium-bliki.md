This is what usually is the very first blog post. With links to some new-old posts, migrated from my 2012 blog.

# Personal Reference Bliki
{: .hide-from-excerpt}

Everyone who has worked with me for a while knows I'm really hyped about the
Pragmatic Programmers. My original idea back in 2012 was to blog about their
pragmatic tips, but this blog has instead turned into more of a "personal reference bliki".

<!--more-->

#### Reference

Turns out I usually blog about a framework or library that I learned and basically wrote
as short a version of their documentation as possible, trying to let the code speak
for itself and resorting to text only for things that cannot be expressed as code
more succinctly.

For example, the [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com) library is used in many a project but
each time I needed something I hadn't done in a while I had to revert to their docs.
Their documentation is great but I usually need to know only that one small thing.
Our [Moment.js blog post](https://itenium.be/blog/javascript/momentjs/)
is about 10 pages and it covers, in pretty much the same detail, 80 pages of the 
[official docs](http://momentjs.com/docs/).


#### Bliki

Blog posts might be updated later on:
- To fix typos, broken code or add links
- Update things if they no longer hold true
- To reflect changes in the API after a major release of the library
- As I learn more about the subject
- To add more/less context
- Or... When I changed my mind about something :)

The name shamelessly stolen from [Martin Fowler's bliki](https://martinfowler.com/).

#### Personal

Some blog posts are used for me to link to avoid
[Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
Instead of doing the full detailing once again, I try to coerce my colleagues
to the relevant blog post instead.

But most are basically to force myself to read the docs and/or revert to when
I pick up a project that is using a library I haven't used in a while.


PS: There is a [The Pragmatic Programmer 20th Anniversary Edition](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition)
coming up. I should probably pre-order.

## Pragmatic Tips

**The Pragmatic Tips blog posts from back in 2012:**

[**Pragmatic Tip 1: Care About Your Craft**](/blog/productivity/pragmatic-tip-1-care-about-your-craft/)

[**Pragmatic Tip 2: Think! About Your Work**](/blog/productivity/pragmatic-tip-2-think-about-your-work/)


<br>

Do I still stand by it after 7 years?
Pretty much. There wasn't anything I thought I should **really** remove so there's that.
Should I write now on those two tips, I do think the articles would turn out radically different though :)

The second post ends with _Next up is “Provide Options, Don’t Make Lame Excuses”, one of my favorite tips!_  
So yeah, I'll try not to make any promises on this blog anymore.

## Uhoh
